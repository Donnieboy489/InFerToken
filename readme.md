# InFerToken
InFer is a bep-20 token that distributes bnb to wallet holders. 


That is a simple explanation but there is a lot happening behind the scenes when this token is traded. 

Functionalities;
- 6% bnb distributed to holders
- 2% transfered to dead wallet
- 2% to liquidity pool
- 2-4% on buy/sell respectively, to the vault wallet
- Transaction limit of .1% of the supply in a 24hr period, this allows our price floor to steadily increase through the burn that is instituted and the automatic amount that is also transfered to the liquidity pool in pancake swap.

All of this information can be found in our whitepaper and we also have a document showing proof of our contracts working along with the testnet link so that our community can have peace of mind. Infer automatically locks team wallets and will keep them locked until 6 months after launch. This is one of the many safeguards that we have in place to protect our community. InFer will be available exclusively on the bankerdoge platform and will be listed on pancakeswap. 

We are in works with Bankerdoge to create a Vault for InFer token to allow our community to stake their tokens and be eligible for dual-token rewards. This Vault will utilize the remaining tokens that were not delegated to be sold on the Bankerdoge platform. These tokens will continue to provide liquidity while our team starts development on our platform. This secures the extra tokens and allows our community the opportunity to farm more until the release of our dapp and play-to-earn platform. At that time, InFer will be utilized as a governance token and the ramining tokens from the Vault will be dedicated to boosting our play-to-earn ecosystem and allow our users to gain even further yields while trading or gaming on our platform. 

Our project strives to make it easier to use web3 and we want to foster decentralization and trading while giving enough structure to make our project successful. 

Of note: After launch we will have a certik audit done to further exemplify our dedication to this project.
Thank you,
InFer Team.
